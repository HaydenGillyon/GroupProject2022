### <u>Achim , Network security Research</u>#

We are in a transition phase where we are going to have increasing network stability with little no no mechanical automatons

hackers  are the new pirates , 

### pirates used to :

- use physical force
- is on site
- usually known to the locals

Attacks

- focused on local targets
- focused on geographic targets

### modern pirates:

the attacker

- little physical force or none
- can be everywhere
- is part of international network

Attacks

- can happen everywhere
- can be targeted or opportunistic 
- target any system that uses software



Researching network protocols in a formal way that is computable.

Isabell

- based on realistic protocol model
- unbounded number of sessions or agents
- interactive

### Research : Safe and secure data structures for web application

compartmentalise JavaScript components

Conclusion : can come up with with more safe and secure web components



### Programming Languages

Smart contracts

- are computer programs mixing

  -  the rules / obligations of a contract with the strategy of the parties

  How do ensure that they

- describe our intention

- free of bugs

- are not vulnerable

work to formalise a tool to detect  vulnerabilities.

formal validation of business process models.



### Light weight symmetric cryptography

Research question 

- Can we build 

  -  fast
  - lightweight and
  - secure

  

FPGA  , only contains logical gates .



econPlaca - team of economists  , have a new web forum to discuss pseudo anon and anon discussions

the law vs technical feasibility -
